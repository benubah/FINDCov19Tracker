# FINDCov19Tracker

Our interactive map uses publicly available data to show the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests that have been performed in each country, and the number of positive cases.
The map was developed using [open-source code](https://github.com/eparker12/nCoV_tracker) initially developed by the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/)

Several countries and entities including the World Bank are publishing aggregate estimates on the total number of tests performed.
These reports are published across individual websites, statistical reports and press releases â€“ often in multiple languages and updated with different periodicity.
Although there is currently no centralized database and many countries do not publish official reports on volumes of tests performed, we are working to build a global picture of how many people are being tested for COVID-19.

### Data sources 

**Test data** : Collated everyday by the FIND team, from information found online. [x] countries are updated automatically running the [x] script found in the main folder. The source test file is then saved in the dropbox folder under the name coronavirus_tests_YYYYMMDD_sources_SO.csv

**Case data** : Downloaded daily from the COVID19 JHU repository: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

### R Package Workflow Description

We make use of an R package structure to process the downloaded data.
The workflow is automated via GitHub Actions in [dsbbfinddx/FindCov19TrackerData](https://github.com/dsbbfinddx/FindCov19TrackerData).

- `process_jhu_data()`: Main function which starts all JHU data processing.
  Calls `download_jhu_data()`, `preprocess_jhu_data()` and `check_jhu_data()`.
  Writes `processed/coronavirus_cases.csv`.
  
- `process_test_data()`: Main function which starts all "test" data processing.
  Calls `create_covid_data()`.
  Writes `processed/coronavirus_tests.csv`.
  
- `create_shiny_data()`: Makes use of `coronavirus_cases.csv` and `coronavirus_tests.csv`.
  Writes `processed/data_shiny.csv` which is being used by the shiny app.
